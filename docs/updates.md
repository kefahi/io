# Update Week1: Sat, Sep 3
======

Intensive research is being conducted on available open source technologies that can be leveraged. So far I came across the following:

1. A new hypermedia distribution protocol called [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/)
2. Peer-to-peer messaging and media can be done via either the [Tox](https://tox.chat/) protocol, [BitMessage](https://bitmessage.org) or [Web RTC](https://webrtc.org/).
3. Flat-file-based content management: two interesting projects: 
[Grav](https://github.com/getgrav/grav)
[Bludit](https://github.com/dignajar/bludit)
[Typesetter CMS](http://www.typesettercms.com/)


I am also trying to make my mind around the language/technology that should be used for the first reference implementation. The following are being considered (it should be web/mobile friendly of course):

1. Typescript/(Angular2 or Sencha EXTJs)/VisJS for the front-end
2. QT (QML and gang): Mainly a native app that is cross-platform
3. Yii2/php
Still looking for a good DHT implementation. We need couple DHT repos:
1. Content (content-addressible)
2. Identity (Identity Service Provisioning)
Also getting more and more convinced with using GraphQL for schema interrogation and data query: [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) not sure if it can be used with [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/)

Call for action: Please go over this and provide any further input/thoughts you may have. Feel free to ask questions as well.
