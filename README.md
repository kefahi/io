Data Management System

The name comes from the Arabic word "سدر" which is the plural for Rhamnus (a tree that grows in the Arabian Peninsula and Levant with dense branches and leaves and deep roots); the singular form is Sedra "سدرة".

This project aims at providing a unified Data Management System that would deliver the functionalities of the systems below:
- Blogger/CMS (e.g. Wrodpress)
- Wiki (e.g. Dokuwiki)
- Ticketing system (e.g. Redmine)
- Instant and offline messages( e.g. XMPP and SMTP/IMAP)
- Dictionary
- Ticketing system
- Invoicing system
- Inventory system
- File management (e.g. OwnCloud)
- Spreadsheet (e.g. Excel)

Looking at all the functions above, its clear that they all revolve around data, meta data and presentation. 

## Principles 
* Data and changes are *almost* immutable (pretty much like git - or based on it - ). This immutability should come at minimal storage overhead (only historic delta's are saved, along with the full most uptodate version)
* Entry-oriented (document oriented): All the related data to an entry (Meta-data, actual content and any file hierarchy) is self contained in the entry object. That is comprssed (e.g. entry_abc.tar.bz2). Each entry has a pointer to the respective module (including its specific version requirements) that has the format specifications and can interact with the entry.
* Graph-enabled. Entries can have pointers (relations + attributes) to each other.
* Modular data handlers: Modules that can ingest various types of data: Text, PDF, eBook, Media (Images, Audio, Video), JSON, CSV, Xml, Doc, Excel, Presentation, Avro, ORCFile, Parquet, Sqlite3 db ... etc. A Data handler module also includes the necessary code to parse, enrich and expose data/meta data. Each module would have ...
  * Indexer / Analyzer
  * Schema definition
  * Reader/Writer/Convertor
  * Presentation Layer
  * Binaris / Logic / code
* Data entries are indexed so they can be searched. (using Lucene?)
* Its all JVM-base initially.
* Security: Proper access management and an entry is signed by its author
* API Interface that encompasses all the features. High-performance Non-blocking. (netty?)
* UI that interacts with the API; Views (list/Gride/cards/tree/graph), search interface, CRUD. 
* Distriuted and decentralized. Just like/on top of your regular file/email/cms systems.
* Does not rely on a Database engine; but rather has the data in textual representation (e.g. JSON)
* Miners are additional components responsible for two things: finding new content and improving the quality/meta information of it. They mine local and external sedras looking for new content and new perspective on already existing content.

## Technologies
Nothing is determined yet. Going now though a research phase.

* Git
* .tar.bz2
* JSON/Avro for schema definitions
* Php
* Admin LTE/Angular/Metis/SB Admin/Webix
* Yii2


## File structure
* Indexes section (temprary indexes generated on the fly)
* Data repository 
* Data revision history
* Meta data (Lineage, schema, History)
* Modules (code/binaries)
